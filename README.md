On May 15, 2023 I will give a talk on software radios for the hobbyist.  No math just what hardware and software is available for the hobbyist and my recommendation to get started.

On Sept 11, 2023 I will be giving a talk on Introduction to Vacuum Tubes.

On April 9, 2024 I planned a review of a talk "Our home the Milky Way GalaxY." I wanted comments from Pat W.  Everyone decided to sit in on the review so I gave the talk instead of just a review.
