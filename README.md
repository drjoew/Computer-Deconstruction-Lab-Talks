# Computer-Deconstuction-Lab-Talks
Talks given at CDL- Computer Deconstruction Lab   www.compdecon.org   https://groups.io/g/cdl/topics 

Intro to Linux is to help new users of Linux decide if they want to use it on their computer

A later talk will describe how to install common versions of Linux

On May 15, 2023 I will give a talk on software radios for the hobbyist.  No math just what hardware and software is available for the hobbyist and my recommendation to get started.
